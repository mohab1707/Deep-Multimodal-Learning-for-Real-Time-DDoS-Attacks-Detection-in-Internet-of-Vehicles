# Deep-Multimodal-Learning-for-Real-Time-DDoS-Attacks-Detection-in-Internet-of-Vehicles
Brief description of the project...
## 1. Data Preprocessing
To ensure a balanced dataset, we preprocess the train and validation datasets collected using the F2MD framework on the Real-time Simulation LuSTMini scenario with 80% attacker density.
Please take a look at the [Data Preprocessing notebook](./DataPreprocessing.ipynb) for detailed steps and code.
## 2. The Proposed DML Approach
