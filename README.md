# Deep-Multimodal-Learning-for-Real-Time-DDoS-Attacks-Detection-in-Internet-of-Vehicles
Brief description of the project...
## 1. Data Preprocessing
We preprocess the train and validation datasets collected using the F2MD framework on the Real-time Simulation LuSTMini scenario with 80% attacker density to ensure a balanced dataset.
For detailed steps and code, please refer to the Data Preprocessing notebook.
