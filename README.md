# Deep-Multimodal-Learning-for-Real-Time-DDoS-Attacks-Detection-in-Internet-of-Vehicles
Brief description of the project...
## 1. Data Preprocessing
The Train and Validation Datasets are generated using the F2MD framework on the Real-time Simulation LuSTMini scenario with 80% attacker density to ensure a balanced dataset. These datasets contain the BSMs message content and the plausibility checks as extra features.
For an in-depth explanation of the preprocessing datasets, refer to the [Data Preprocessing notebook](./DataPreprocessing.ipynb).
## 2. The Proposed DML Approach
